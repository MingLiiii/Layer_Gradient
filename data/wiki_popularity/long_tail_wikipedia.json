Following the reform, this type of settlement was reduced to rural status and all urban-type settlements were renamed as settlements.\nAccording to the Constitution of Ukraine that was adopted in 1996, the only populated places in Ukraine are cities, settlements and villages (Article 133). No urban-type settlements are mentioned in the Constitution.\n\nHistory\nIn 1925, the designation of urban-type settlement was introduced into the classification system of the Soviet Union. This included the Ukrainian SSR, where it replaced the previous term \"town\" (Ukrainian: \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0447\u043a\u043e, romanized: mistechko). In Crimea, this type of settlement appeared after its transfer to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 and until then similar settlements were known as resort settlements or workers' settlements.\nUkrainian historian Oleksandr Androshchuk described the urban-type settlement as \"a peculiar category of settlements [...] detached from the centuries-old history of urban settlement in Ukraine.\" The number of urban-type settlements in Ukraine increased steadily throughout the 20th century. There were 459 by 1940, 478 by 1950, 823 by 1960, 861 by 1970, 901 by 1980, and 927 by 1990. However, the newly created urban-type settlements often did not have significant differences from traditional villages, with many residents continuing to engage in agricultural lifestyles. Androshchuk notes that \"during the first ten years of Soviet rule on the territory of modern Ukraine, three times more rural settlements were transferred to the category of urban-type settlements than in the previous 300 years\", and argues that such a rapid change was doomed to be ineffective, as it was \"not possible to force yesterday's peasant to wake up in the morning as a city dweller.\"\nIn the years after World War II, many urban-type settlements grew to the point that their statuses were upgraded to that of cities of district subordination, shrinking the former category and growing the latter. This included places like Katyk (now Shakhtarsk), Vatutine, Kivertsi, and Haivoron.\nThe largest wave of urban-type settlement creation took place in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when, according to Oleksandr Androshchuk in 2006, more than half of the urban-type settlements in existence were created. In 1957 alone, 125 settlements became urban-type settlements in Ukraine. A 1965 decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic further clarified the definition of an urban-type settlement, defining it as \"a populated area around an industrial plant, construction site, railway junction, educational institution, research station, sanatorium, or other stationary medical or convalescent establishment that has state housing and over 2,000 residents, 60 percent of whom are wage or salaried workers or members of their families.\" It was also specified that a such settlement may have less than 2,000 people if it is expected to develop further and pass that number.\nIn 1981, the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR passed a resolution further specifying the definition of an urban-type settlement, and making it more clear how settlements could change their status. \nUkraine became independent in 1991, but retained the Soviet-era classifications of inhabited localities for a time. By July 2023, the number of urban-type settlements in the country had fallen to 881. On 24 October 2023, as part of wider decommunization in independent Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed Law No"

        "output": "Hypercallia phlebodes is a moth in the family Depressariidae. It was described by Lord Walsingham in 1912. It is found in Guatemala.\nThe wingspan is about 19 mm. The forewings are yellow, with fawn-brown blotches and bright reddish ferruginous streaks. An elongate fawn-brown blotch occupies the base of the costa above the cell, extending to one-third, with some reddish ferruginous scales intermixed. A second fawn-brown blotch occupies the middle of the costa, descending to the lower edge of the cell, where, at its inner angle, is a black spot, a second black spot lying at the end of the cell a little beyond its outer angle. A dorsal blotch of the same colour, at one-third from the base, is attenuated upwards to the fold, near the first black spot. A third fawn-brown shade occurs along the outer third of the costa, produced through the terminal cilia and connected with a narrow fawn-brown terminal band which shades the pale yellow cilia with brown toward the tornus. An irregular curved line of scattered blackish scales runs parallel to the margin of the wing, from the fold to vein 10, halfway between the cell and the margin. The whole of the bright yellow intermediate space between the somewhat ill-defined brown blotches is mottled with rich reddish ferruginous, each vein being distinctly marked by a line of that colour. The hindwings are greyish white.\n\n\n== References =="

He was a usurper to the throne, but was considered a good ruler, one who loved the common people, although there is a story that he was responsible for the death of High Chief Ke\u014dua. Alapa\u02bbi's title in Hawaiian was Ali\u02bbi.\n\nBiography\nFamily\nAlapa\u02bbi was a son of Chief Kauaua-a-Mahi and Chiefess Kalanikauleleiaiwi. Alapa\u02bbi's brother was Haae-a-Mahi, and Alapa\u02bbi's half-siblings included Keku\u02bbiapoiwa I and Kalanike\u02bbeaumoku, who were also Alapa\u02bbi's first cousins by virtue of Kalanikauleleiaiwi's other marriages. The king of the island was Keawe\u02bb\u012bkekahiali\u02bbiokamoku. Alapa\u02bbi ruled as the chief of Kohala, subordinate to the King of Hawai\u02bbi.\n\nReign\nAfter the death of his uncle Keawe\u02bb\u012bkekahiali\u02bbiokamoku and the subsequent civil war between Kalanike\u02bbeaumoku and Kalaninuiamamao, Alapa\u02bbi emerged as the victor and usurped the throne of Hawai\u02bbi. He reigned during one of the bloodiest period of Hawaiian history in an era of great warrior king fighting for the domination over the neighboring islands.\nWar continued between the century-old rivals Hawai\u02bbi and Maui during the early part of his rule while the old Kekaulike was still on the throne. After Kekaulike's death, his relations with Maui were friendly, and he helped his nephew Kamehamehanui Ai\u02bbl\u016b\u02bbau regain his throne from his half-brother Kauhiaimokuakama. His reign also saw a bitter conflict between Hawai\u02bbi and Oahu over the latter's invasion of the island of Molokai, where Alapa\u02bbi's relatives ruled. Alapa\u02bbi invaded Moloka`i and killed O\u02bbahu's Ali`i Aimoku Kapiiohookalani (Kapiono-o-kalani) at the Battle of Kawela and later invaded the island of O\u02bbahu in 1736. Kanaha-o-kalani became 21st Ali`i Aimoku of O`ahu succeeding his father Kapiiohookalani.\nKapi\u02bbiohookalani's brother Pele\u02bbioholani returned from Kaua\u02bbi and repelled Alapa\u02bbi's invasion force on O`ahu, taking up a counter-offensive on Moloka`i and Maui by allying with Chief Kauhiaimokuakama, Ali`i of Maui. The war eventually ended in a truce between Alapa\u02bbi and Pele\u02bbioholani, and Kauhiaimokuakama was drowned by Alapa\u02bbi's orders.\nWhen his niece Keku\u02bbiapoiwa II was pregnant with Kamehameha I, she had a craving for the eyeball of a shark, a sign that the child would be a killer of chiefs. Alapa\u02bbi secretly made plans to have the newborn infant killed but was thwarted by the intervention Nae\u02bbole who escaped with the child. He later reconciled with the baby and allowed it to be raised at his court placing him in the charge of his favorite wife Keaka.\n\nMarriages\nAlapa\u02bbinui had many wives, but only the names of three principal wives survived, and the name of one minor wife. Alapa\u02bbi's first wife was Keaka. Their son was Keawe\u02bb\u014dpala.\nAlapa\u02bbi's second wife was Kamaka\u02bb\u012bmoku and their daughter was Manono I.\nAlapa\u02bbi's third wife was Kamaua with whom he had Kauwa\u02bba, a daughter, and Mahiua, a son"

Such circumstances are not unusual in Ireland; generally as soon as new road schemes are completed along national roads, the route designation is applied along the new road with new signage. To add to the confusion; in addition to the lack of statute updates (2006 being the first major update since 1994), old signage is often not removed from the original route (e.g. N7 national primary road (white on green) signage along the R445).\nThe old N82 route was signed as the N82 as well as the former route until late 2007.\nThe N82 road was redesignated as the L2011 local road in 2012.\n\nTrivia\nThe route was urban over its entire length, which, at just over 2 km (1.2 mi) made the N82 by far the shortest national secondary road. Despite being recently built it had no hard shoulders, bus lanes or cycle tracks; it was single carriageway narrow two-lane road and had 6 roundabouts in those 2 kilometres.\nThe road was constructed in phases by the private developer of Citywest Business Campus to serve the development and handed over on completion of the final link between the N7 and the N81 to South Dublin County Council.\n\nSee also\nRoads in Ireland\nMotorways in Ireland\nNational primary road\nRegional road\n\n\n== References =="

It is mentioned in the Domesday Book. It was most likely abandoned after the arrival of the Black Death at Weymouth in 1348. All that can be seen now are variations in the ground level. The site is listed on the National Heritage List for England as a Scheduled Monument (no. 1019393), listed on 15 January 1960.\nWhat remains of the village church now forms part of Glebe Cottage, immediately north of the main village site. It has walls consisting of local rubble and the roof covered with modern tiles. Only the chancel and its arch survive from the original medieval church building.\nThe village site is in the parish of Osmington. There was a separate parish of Ringstead until at least the late 15th century. There are four different Ringsteads listed in the Domesday Book, each apparently a separate settlement. One was later given the name \"West Ringstead\". Another, later known as \"Up Ringstead\", may have been at the site of the present Upton House to the east above Ringstead Bay towards White Nothe. The location of \"Middle Ringstead\" is not known. The name of \"East Ringstead\" survived as a field name on an 1829 Tithe Map in the east of the parish.\nThe location of West Ringstead is just inland from the South West Coast Path. To the east are Ringstead Bay and the headland of White Nothe.

Cranmer (n\u00e9e, Powers; after first marriage, Goodell; after second marriage, Cranmer; October 2, 1858 \u2013 January 11, 1937) was an American temperance reformer, woman suffragist, and author. A talented suffrage speaker and prohibition representative, she served as president of the South Dakota Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and the South Dakota Equal Suffrage Association. Some of her epigrams were published by the press. Cranmer died in 1937.\n\nEarly life and education\nEmma Amelia Powers was born in Mount Vernon, Wisconsin, October 2, 1858. She was the daughter of Dr. Joseph Lewis Powers and Janette S. (Byam) Cranmer. Her siblings were Julia C. Powers (born 1856), Laura B. Powers (born 1865), Fred Willard Powers (born 1868), and Leland Earnest Powers (born 1871).\nShe was educated in Cornell College.\n\nCareer\nShe began to teach school when fifteen years old. In 1880, she married Delos N. Goodell, who died in 1882. \nIn October, 1884, she married secondly, Hon. Simeon Harris Cranmer (1853\u20131943), a Nebraska teacher and lawyer. They made their home in Aberdeen, South Dakota in 1889, after he became president of the Union Banking Company. \nIn 1890, Mr. and Mrs. Cranmer established an industrial school for young woman who had jobs but did not have previous education, which included no-cost instruction in literature, mathematics, reading, and writing.\nCranmer wrote much for the press, both in prose and verse. Epigrams published by the press included, \u201cApplause is like strychnine, it either acts as a tonic or a poison\", \u201cDrunkenness is a disease to be treated by the physician and not the policeman\u201d, and \u201cWhat is needed in our progress is more schools and fewer jails\". \nShe lectured on literary subjects and on temperance in many of the cities of the Northwest. As an orator she was eloquent and winning. She was an earnest worker in the white ribbon movement, with which she was connected for years, and served as president of the South Dakota WCTU. On June 9, 1893, she attended the World's Temperance Congress in Washington D.C. and sat on the platform during the opening by Matilda Carse.\nIn equal suffrage, she was profoundly interested, and served as president of the South Dakota Equal Suffrage Association. Through efforts of Cranmer and Anna R. Simmons, a bill was secured for a constitutional amendment from the South Dakota Legislature of 1893. In addition to Simmons, her contemporaries in South Dakota included, Irene G. Adams and Ida R. Bailey.\n\nPersonal life\nCranmer became a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church in her early childhood, and was a class leader in her church. Later, she became a Christian Science practitioner.\nShe had one child, a daughter, Frances Willard Cranmer. \nEmma Amelia Cranmer died January 11, 1937, in Minnesota, and is buried at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nReferences\nAttribution\nThis article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain:  Gue, Benjamin F.; Shambaugh, Benjamin Franklin (1899).

This would trigger the creation of the League of Cambrai and the beginning of the War of the League of Cambrai.\n\nBackground\nThe coronation of Maximilian I and the Diet of Constance\nIn 1507, Louis XII of France had conquered Genoa and in fact dominated much of northern Italy, having already conquered the Duchy of Milan in 1500. Such preponderance in lands so close to his borders troubled the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg, already worried by the French attempts to award the papal seat to Georges d'Amboise, archbishop of Rouen, who proposed to crown the King of the French as emperor. Worried by this, and anxious to stress the role of the Empire, Maximilian I summoned the diet in Constance (April 1507), where in front of the princes and the electors he exposed his concerns about the excessive French power in Italy and the repercussions that such a situation could have in the matters of Germany; he thus managed to persuade the princes to fund an invasion of Italy. Maximilian I proposed himself as defender of the Church, declared Louis XII an enemy of Christianity and announcing his coming to Rome to be crowned Emperor and guarantee the freedom of the holy city. Louis XII immediately denied any aims towards the Empire or St. Peter, staying in Genoa without an army to demonstrate his peaceful intentions, but the diet granted Maximilian I eight thousand knights and twenty-two thousand infantry for six months.\n\nHabsburg preparations\nThe first movements of the imperial armies on the borders of Cadore and towards Friuli began between 9 and 10 January 1508, leading Bartolomeo d'Alviano to carry out inspections of the castles of Botestagno and Chiusaforte, reinforcing the fortresses, ordering a moat to be dug in Primolano and ramparts built in Celazzo and Laurone. On 24 January 1508 an imperial messenger reached Verona asking the mayor, Alvise Malipiero, to prepare lodgings for 8,500 horses, since Emperor Maximilian intended to stay there for three days before continuing to Rome. The mayor decided to take his time and relayed Maximilian's request to Venice. The Council of Ten sent a reply stating that the Serenissima would grant him passage as long as the emperor intended to cross its territory \"quietly and peacefully\". On the other hand, the Venetians had many reasons to consider Maximilian's request nothing more than a pretext for the invasion. They therefore decided to strengthen the Rovereto garrison and to evacuate the town of women, children and other useless mouths, while a garrison of 500 infantrymen under the command of Dionigi Naldi was deployed in Brentonico, and an embassy was sent to Charles II d'Amboise, Grand Master of France and governor of Milan, requesting to send reinforcements under the command of Gian Giacomo Trivulzio. In the following days the hostile intent of the imperials became evident as more and more men gathered around Trento and began to plunder the Lagarina Valley north of Rovereto and the Asiago plateau.\n\nInvasion of Cadore\nOn 4 February, Pietro Gixi, captain of Cadore, was informed of the arrival around Bruneck of about three hundred German knights and hundreds of infantrymen who, however, did not immediately attack the Venetians as the mountain passes were blocked by the large amount of snow that had fallen in the previous weeks"

However, some instances of the IMPDH motif are not upstream of protein-coding genes.  Therefore, it is ambiguous whether IMPDH RNAs function as cis-regulatory elements or whether they operate in trans.\nThe IMPDH RNA motif includes one pseudoknot, but one stem involved in this apparent pseudoknot exhibits only one example of covariation, so the existence of the pseudoknot is unclear.\nThe motif does not bind as a riboswitch. Instead, it is suggested that it regulates transcription by \"misincorporation\" of inosine instead of one of the usual nucleotides (with ITP in place of GTP) into a string of RNA. In Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, this causes transcription to be terminated. There may also be a role for the motif's binding to the bacterium's IMPDH protein.\n\n\n== References =="

The district capital is Krakor town located 25 kilometres east of the provincial capital, Pursat town.\n\nLocation\nKrakor is the easternmost district of Pursat province and borders Kampong Chhnang province to the east. To the north the district encompasses a portion of the Tonle Sap lake and there are several villages on the edge of the lake. These are Tonle Sap floating villages and their location moves depending on the water level in the lake. The districts of Kandieng and Sampov Meas form the eastern border and Phnum Kravanh district lies to the south. The district capital is at Krakor town, which is located on National Highway Number 5 about 160 kilometres by road from Phnom Penh.\n\nAdministration\nThe following table shows the villages of Krakor district by commune.\n\nCharacteristics\nAccording to the 1998 Census, Krakor district is made up of 11 communes and 103 villages. The population of the district was 74,222 in 14,347 households at the time of the last census.\nThe national highway and the only north-south rail link in the country bisect the district and thus most villages in the district have comparatively good access to goods and services. There is a former district Hospital at Krakor town  and the provincial capital and higher level services are only a short distance away. There is an active market that spills over onto the highway at Krakor town and this combined with the recent resurfacing of the highway has led to increasing traffic accidents and road fatalities.\n\nFishing Conflicts\nLocated on the Tonle Sap, Krakor district is well known for fishing and prahok trey ngiet and other fish products are exported to markets in Pursat and Phnom Penh. Most of these fish are collected by floating fishing villages in the northern part of the district, near the district town. These villagers have had an uneasy relationship with Fishery Administration officials over claims of illegal fishing in protected areas of the lake. In April 2007 this unease culminated in an incident that led to the deaths of three fishermen and the torching of the commune fisheries office. Three fishermen, including a pregnant woman, were shot and killed with AK-47s by a group of Fisheries officials who claimed they were attacked by the fishermen.\n\n\n== References =="

Borki village lies on the left low-lying bank of river Kozynka and Borki towers over it, lying on a steep slope on the right bank opposite. The total area of the reserve is 220 hectares. In the north, it is bordered by the Reserve Borki village, on the south it is surrounded by a perimeter of crop fields.\n\nVegetation\nStudy of vegetation in Borki was initiated by botanist V. M. Chernyaev in 1821. At that time Borki contained upland oak forest, within which was the pine grove of pine chalk (Pinus sylvestris var. cretacea). Traces of the oaks are still visible in the bushes on a steep slope descending to Kozynka. A pine grove was completely destroyed at the beginning of the twentieth century. Now on the slopes of the tract Borki there is forb-grass steppe vegetation which alternates with outcrops of Cretaceous rocks (marl). At the end of the last century in the upper part of Tracts slopes, people created small artificial plantations of black pine.\nIn Borki there are three types of plants listed in the Red Book of Russia: Daphne sophia, Cotoneaster alaunicus, stipa pennata. Shrub Daphne sofia is the kind endemic to the Don basin. It occurs on the steep northern slope, among other shrubs and herbs with a dash of cereals. It was first discovered here in 1903 by V. I.

In 1327 he was steward to Walter Reynolds, Archbishop of Canterbury, and the following year he sat on a commission of oyer and terminer in Surrey, suggesting that he was a qualified lawyer (in Ireland at least this was not at the time a requirement to be a Baron of the  Court of Exchequer).\n\nHe was sent to Ireland as Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1329 and served in that office for two years. In 1330 John de Mohun appointed Braideston and his colleague John de Grauntsete as his attorneys. Braideston returned to England shortly after, and was still living in 1334.\n\nReferences\nBall, F.
