Let's verify these steps more carefully. 3. **Determine the time it takes for Printers Y and Z to complete the job together:**\n    - Since they complete \\( \\frac{11}{150} \\) of the job per hour, the time to complete one job is:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Time} = \\frac{1 \\text{ job}}{\\frac{11}{150} \\text{ job/hour}} = \\frac{150}{11} \\text{ hours}\n    \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the ratio of the times:**\n    - Time for Printer X to complete the job is 12 hours. , CNO can sit on the left and CNGB on the right, or vice versa), providing \\( 2 \\) arrangements for each configuration:\n\\[ 24 \\cdot 2 = 48 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Subtract the Number of Invalid Arrangements from the Total\nFrom the total number of arrangements (where CNO and CNGB may or may not be next to each other), we subtract the number of arrangements where they are next to each other. Hence, we set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 4d + 2p = 4(d + p) - 18 \\]\n\nTo simplify and solve this equation, follow these steps:\n\n1. Distribute the 4 on the right-hand side of the equation:\n\\[ 4d + 2p = 4d + 4p - 18 \\]\n\n2. Subtract \\( 4d \\) from both sides to begin isolating \\( p \\):\n\\[ 2p = 4p - 18 \\]\n\n3. Subtract \\( 4p \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 2p - 4p = -18 \\]\n\\[ -2p = -18 \\]\n\n4. Simplify to solve for \\( p \\):\n\\[ p = \\frac{-18}{-2} \\]\n\\[ p = 9 \\]\n\nSo, there are 9 peacocks in the group. ### Step 1: Total Number of Groups\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 students out of 6 can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of students, and \\( k \\) is the number of students to choose. 4. **Number of Players Eliminated:**\n   - To have one winner, 54 players must be eliminated (since 55 players - 1 winner = 54 players eliminated). 7. **Conclusively:**\n   - The only pattern matching these stipulations reflect an incomplete week contraction always starting from the same limited premise of non-repetitive day cycling within the iterations. - In the **second minute**, Pipe B fills \\( \\frac{1}{24} \\) of the cistern.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **First Minute:**\n   - Toast sides 1 of bread \\( A \\) and bread \\( B \\) in the two slots. - Set \\( N \\) has 28 distinct elements. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net rate} = \\left( \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{12} \\right) - \\frac{1}{20}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Combined Rate of Pipe A and Pipe B:**\n   Let's find a common denominator to add \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\). 5. **Putting It All Together**:\n   - The initial number of arrangements, fixing one brother, is (9-1)! = 8!. 5000 to yield a simple interest of Rs. - Recall: \\(1 \\text{ km/h} = \\frac{5}{18} \\text{ m/s}\\). After those 28 days (4 weeks), the remaining days will define which days of the week are missing. Therefore, there are 2 favorable outcomes. So option (A) seems fit. We can add these two equations to eliminate \\( v_s \\):\n\n\\[\n(v_b + v_s) + (v_b - v_s) = 11 + 5\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\n2v_b = 16\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nv_b = \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\text{ km/hr}\n\\]\n\nThus, the speed of the boat in still water is 8 km/hr. We are given:\n1. The speed of the boat upstream = 60 kmph\n2. The speed of the boat downstream = 100 kmph\n\nThe relationship between these speeds can be expressed with the following formulas:\n- Speed upstream = \\( B - S \\)\n- Speed downstream = \\( B + S \\)\n\nWe can set up the following equations based on the given information:\n1. \\( B - S = 60 \\)\n2. \\( B + S = 100 \\)\n\nTo solve these two equations, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. So, instead of arranging 10 individual books, we now arrange 9 units (the pair counts as 1 unit, plus the other 8 individual books). 3. Subtract \\( 2C \\) from both sides:\n   - \\( 2C = 14 \\). 1. **Define the Original Price and Sale Price:**\n   - Let the original price of the shoes be \\(P\\). 3. **Use the formula for distance:**\n   - The distance \\(d\\) covered by the train can be found using the formula \\(d = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time}\\). 3. **Wheel 3 (Third Digit):** With two digits already used by the first and second wheels, there will be \\(10 - 2 = 8\\) choices left for the third wheel. 5. **Establishing the profit condition:**\n   - The desired overall profit is 20%. - \\( P(B) \\) is the probability that the archer hits the bullseye from 70 yards, which is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\). It is given as 20 kmph. - Therefore, the rate per day for 4 girls is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Rate for 4 girls} = \\frac{48 \\text{ meters}}{2 \\text{ days}} = 24 \\text{ meters/day}\n     \\]\n   - Thus, 4 girls color 24 meters in one day. First, we simplify the condition that \\( \\frac{14g}{60} \\) is an integer:\n\\[ \\frac{14g}{60} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 2 \\cdot g}{2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{7g}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{7g}{30} \\]\nFor \\(\\frac{7g}{30}\\) to be an integer, \\( g \\) must be such that the numerator, \\( 7g \\), includes all the prime factors in the denominator, \\( 30 \\), which has the prime factors \\( 2, 3, \\) and \\( 5 \\). - Downstream speed (\\(V_{down}\\)): This is the speed when the boat is moving with the current. Let \\( x \\) be the number of liters of oil A to be mixed with 240 liters of oil B. - The next prime number is **59**. (E) 6 - This is far below the mean's calculated range. Hence:\n\n\\[ \\frac{700 + h_1 + h_2}{6} > 175 \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6 to clear the denominator:\n\n\\[ 700 + h_1 + h_2 > 1050 \\]\n\nSubtracting 700 from both sides to simplify:\n\n\\[ h_1 + h_2 > 350 \\]\n\nNow, let's examine each pair of heights provided in the options to see if they satisfy this inequality:\n\n(A) 179 cm and 172 cm:\n\\[ 179 + 172 = 351 \\]\n\\[ 351 > 350 \\]\nThis satisfies the inequality. We need to determine how many liters of oil priced at Rs.40 per liter (let's call it oil A) should be mixed with 240 liters of oil priced at Rs.60 per liter (let's call it oil B) to get a mixture that costs Rs.52 per liter. to 12 p.

Let's break down the steps clearly:\n\n1. **Determine the total age of the 32 students:**\n   The average age of 32 students is 16 years. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the given information\n- 4 men can color 48 meters of cloth in 2 days. This means when A finishes 600 metres, B has only run 540 metres. 2. **Determine the total distance to be covered while crossing the bridge:**\n   - The bridge is 3 kilometers long, which is 3000 meters. 3. **Calculate the Change in Price:**\n   - The change in price when moving from the sale price back to the original price is \\(P - 0.86P = 0.14P\\). ### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Use the Exercise-Time Ratio (Gym : Bicycle = 2 : 3)**\n   Since the ratio of gym work to bicycle riding is 2:3, we can express \\( G \\) and \\( B \\) as:\n   \\[\n   G = \\frac{2}{5}E \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B = \\frac{3}{5}E\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find \\( E \\) (Total Exercise Time) using \\( B \\) (Biking Time)**\n   Given that \\( B = 16 \\) minutes, we can substitute \\( B \\) into the proportion:\n   \\[\n   16 = \\frac{3}{5}E \\implies E = \\frac{16 \\times 5}{3} = \\frac{80}{3} \\approx 26.67 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Total Exercise Time \\( E \\)**\n   So, Mandy's total exercise time \\( E \\) is approximately 26.67 minutes.

Therefore, the total number of legs is \\( 4d + 2p \\). Total length of the train:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total length} = 24 \\times 60 \\text{ meters} + 60 \\text{ meters} = 1440 \\text{ meters} + 60 \\text{ meters} = 1500 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total distance to be covered:**\n   - The train has to pass completely over the bridge.

To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the following conversion factor:\n\\[ 1 \\, \\text{km/hr} = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{meters}}{3600 \\, \\text{seconds}} = \\frac{5}{18} \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nSo, the speed in m/s is:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = 60 \\, \\text{km/hr} \\times \\frac{5}{18} \\, \\text{m/s per km/hr} \\]\n\nPerform the multiplication:\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = 60 \\times \\frac{5}{18} = \\frac{60 \\times 5}{18} = \\frac{300}{18} = 16.67 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the distance (length of the train)\nNext, use the formula for distance, which is derived from speed and time:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\nWe know the train’s speed is 16.67 m/s and it takes 9 seconds to cross the pole, so:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 16.67 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 9 \\, \\text{seconds} \\]\n\nPerform the multiplication:\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 16.67 \\times 9 = 150 \\, \\text{meters} \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe length of the train is 150 meters. To find the probability that she misses the bullseye on all three shots, we multiply these probabilities:\n\\[ P(\\text{Miss all}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2}{15} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{2}{15} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{30} = \\frac{1}{15} \\]\n\nSo, the probability that she misses the bullseye on all three shots is \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\). Simplify the right side expression:\n\\[ 28 + 2H = 14 + 2H + 14 \\]\n\\[ 28 + 2H = 28 + 2H \\]. ### Step 1: Convert the speed\n1 kilometer per hour (kmph) is equivalent to \\(\\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{3600 \\text{ seconds}}\\). 1. 25 is a perfect square (\\(5^2 = 25\\)). **Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Identify the Key Condition:**\n   - The product of the digits must be even. Using our determined side length of \\( 3P \\):\n   \\[\n   A = (\\text{side length})^2 = (3P)^2 = 9P^2\n   \\]\n\nHence, the area of the square is \\( 9P^2 \\). So, \\(B\\) alone will take \\( \\boxed{12} \\) hours to complete the work. Using \\( b + s = 30 \\):\n\n\\[ 24 + s = 30 \\]\n\\[ s = 30 - 24 \\]\n\\[ s = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed of the stream \\( s \\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]\n\nSo the correct answer is \\( \\text{Option (B) } 6 \\text{ kmph} \\)"

Thus, \\( g \\) has exactly 3 different positive prime factors. - Thus, it is not a prime number. Then, we will calculate how many of those groups will include a particular student. 2. **Determine the new average when the teacher's age is added**:\n   - The new average age, when the teacher is included, increases to 17 years. **Step 1: Calculate the compound amount for 20% p. However, it seems my simplification of the fraction has a mistake. Step-by-step calculation of the differences:\n\n1. \\( 860 - 370 = 490 \\)\n2. \\( 1550 - 860 = 690 \\)\n3. \\( 2440 - 1550 = 890 \\)\n4. \\( 3530 - 2440 = 1090 \\)\n\nNow, let's list these differences:\n\n\\[ 490, 690, 890, 1090 \\]\n\nNext, we observe that the differences themselves form a sequence. After those 28 days (4 weeks), the remaining days will define which days of the week are missing. - The probability of missing from 80 yards: \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\). 2,500 each. is \\( \\boxed{50} \\)"

    "output": "To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of man-days, which represents the amount of work one man can complete in one day. **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1. **1-digit numbers:**\n   The digits available are 1, 2, 3, and 5. Hence, the valid 1-digit numbers are:\n   \\[\n   1, 2, 3, 5\n   \\]\n   So, there are 4 one-digit numbers. Thus on re-calculations and fixing it seems the proper ratio is on corrected 4/11 time. Here are the detailed steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Convert the speed from km/h to m/s:**\n   - Speed in km/h: 54 km/h\n   - Conversion factor: 1 km/h = 5/18 m/s\n   - Therefore, speed in m/s = \\( 54 \\times \\frac{5}{18} \\)\n   - Simplify the conversion: \\( 54 \\times \\frac{5}{18} = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\) m/s\n\n2. **Calculate the total distance the train needs to cover:**\n   - Length of the train = 540 meters\n   - Length of the tunnel = 180 meters\n   - Total distance = Length of the train + Length of the tunnel\n   - Total distance = 540 meters + 180 meters = 720 meters\n\n3. **Use the formula for time:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n   - Distance = 720 meters\n   - Speed = 15 m/s\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{720\\ \\text{meters}}{15\\ \\text{m/s}} = 48\\ \\text{seconds}\n   \\]\n\nHence, the time taken by the train to cross the tunnel is 48 seconds. - For the remaining \\( 35 - x \\) days, \\((n - 5)\\) men work because 5 men have left. - 1 kilometer per hour is equal to \\(\\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{3600 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{5}{18} \\text{ meters per second}\\). Assuming the next difference will follow the pattern:\n\n\\[ 1090 + 200 = 1290 \\]\n\nThus the next difference is 1290, which we can add to the last number in the sequence to predict the next term:\n\n\\[ 3530 + 1290 = 4820 \\]\n\nHowever, we were not directly asked for the next term in the sequence directly, but rather identifying how the sequence could differently arise out of those options; options/values provided:\n\nFor those adjusted context:\n\n(A) 900\n(B) 840\n(C) 750\n(D) 860\n(E) 80\n\nIf asked in situ, might reflect values:\nDirect checking doesn’t reveal those sequence fits well, validate closely:\n\n-The differences: doesn't affect;\nthus for given sequence pattern the best choice close adherence to 860 (which revalidate). 9261.\n\nSo, the correct option is:\n(B) 9261"

Here's a detailed step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Determine the work rates of A and B individually:**\n   - Person A can complete the work in 30 days. - Once A is chosen, there are \\(3\\) choices remaining for the second digit (B). For 10 students:\n\\[ (10-1)! = 9! \\]\n\n### Step 2: Ways A and D Can Sit Together\nTo count the number of ways that A and D sit together, think of A and D as forming one \"block\" or \"super student\". So, the number of cows \\( C = 7 \\) satisfies the given conditions. 2. **Calculating the Simple Interest**:\n   Given:\n   \\[\n   P = 18000 \\, \\text{Rs}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   R = 15\\%\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   T = 4 \\, \\text{years}\n   \\]\n\n   Plug these values into the simple interest formula:\n   \\[\n   SI = \\frac{18000 \\times 15 \\times 4}{100}\n   \\]\n   \n   Let's first multiply the values:\n   \\[\n   18000 \\times 15 = 270000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   270000 \\times 4 = 1080000\n   \\]\n\n   Now, divide by 100:\n   \\[\n   SI = \\frac{1080000}{100} = 10800 \\, \\text{Rs}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Amount**:\n   The total amount \\(A\\) that Kiran receives is the sum of the principal amount and the simple interest:\n   \\[\n   A = P + SI\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   A = 18000 + 10800 = 28800 \\, \\text{Rs}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount Kiran gets after 4 years is Rs. This detailed calculation clearly shows that 72 is the number of ways to seat the Chiefs such that CNO and CNGB are not next to each other"
